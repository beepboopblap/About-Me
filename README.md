I'm extremely passionate in the industry relating to the study of physiology and the idea of biology in connection with sports. I'm diligent, motivated, and a team player. I'm currently a IB Diploma student based in Hong Kong, and aim to pursue higher education in the US.


### Education

Through my early years at Sha Tin College, I wasn't as devoted into studying and making the best of my education. I started off with failing grades on nearly all of my subjects. However, it was until year 10 where I started to become academically disciplined and created an scholastic comeback. For my IGCSE/GCSEs, I had earned an equivalent to 7 As, which demonstrates the motivation I have for my education.

Here are the 6 classes I take for IBDP (not including core subjects):

- Higher Level History
- Higher Level Biology
- Higher Level Sports, Exercise, and Health Science
- Standard Level English Language and Literature
- Standard Level B Chinese
- Standard Level Application and Interpretation Mathematics
