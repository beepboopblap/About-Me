# Hi, I'm Nicholas.

I'm extremely passionate in the industry relating to the study of physiology and the idea of biology in connection with sports. I'm diligent, motivated, and a team player. I'm currently a IB Diploma student based in Hong Kong, and aim to pursue higher education in the US.

### Education

Through my early years at Sha Tin College, I wasn't as devoted into studying and making the best of my education. I started off with failing grades on nearly all of my subjects. However, it was until year 10 where I started to become academically disciplined and created an scholastic comeback. For my IGCSE/GCSEs, I had earned an equivalent to 7 As, which demonstrates the motivation I have for my education.

**Here are the 6 classes I take for IBDP (not including core subjects):**

- Higher Level History
- Higher Level Biology
- Higher Level Sports, Exercise, and Health Science
- Standard Level English Language and Literature
- Standard Level B Chinese
- Standard Level Application and Interpretation Mathematics

<br>

### Extra Curriculars

In order to achieve excellence outside of my classes, I've joined a number of online MOOCs (massive open online course) on websites such as Coursera and Edx. I'm currently undergoing a 10 week course on an introductory to physiology provided by Duke University, which so far has been very insightful and interesting to human biology lovers like me. I also aim to provide service for society at a local scale, so I signed up to volunteer at a number of Hong Kong NGO's such as the CrossRoads Foundation and Food Angel.

**Some more examples of EC's I'm doing**

- Youth Mental Health First Aid Course - Mental Health Association HK
- Wharton Investment Competition - Wharton Global Youth Programme
- Post Mortem / Health care - Premed Projects UK
